Start out with making a **[starter](/r/sourdough-a-rustic-seed)**, then have a go at the **[basic sourdough](/_recipes/baking-bread/sourdough-basic.md)** which doesn't require any additional equipment. If that was enjoyable, then the **[seeded sourdough](/_recipes/baking-bread/sourdough-a-rustic-seed.md)** is my recommendation for a reliable tasty recipe for consistent baking, and my go to. Requires a few bits of equipment, which I can recommend investing in if you have baked a few loaves and want to continue. Most valuable is the banneton, linen, pyrex dish and baking dish, but a good scale and especially an oven thermometer will remove a lot of uncertainty.

## Equipment
- Banneton (bowl shaped)
- Banneton dusting flour (rice flour, even corn flour, as regular flour sticks)
- Linen cloth (doesn't stick)
- Large Pyrex bowl (mixing and as baking lid, perfect)
- Oven proof metal dish (needs to form a good seal with the pyrex)
- Scale (5kg+)
- Oven thermometer (your oven temp will vary 30-40 degrees or more!)
- Food thermometer (useful for starter maintenance)
- metal bench scraper (if you struggle to work with dough)
- plastic bench scraper (getting the dough out of the mixing bowl gently)
- Sharp Knife (scoring the dough)
- Water spritzer (useful to get an even moisture on the dough)
- Space in the fridge!
- Big starter jar (prevents overflows and makes mixing easier)
- spatula (for mixing the starter)
- Water measuring jar (allows accurate pouring)
- Bread knife (your bread deserves a sharp knife)
- Bottle brush (banneton maintenance)
