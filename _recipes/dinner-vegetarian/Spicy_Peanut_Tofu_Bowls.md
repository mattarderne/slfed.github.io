## Ingredients
**Tofu**
- 2 blocks of extra firm tofu
- 1–2 tablespoons cornstarch
- olive oil and salt
- 2 small (or 1 large) head of broccoli, cut into florets
- 2 red bell peppers, cut into strips
- 1 1/2 cups uncooked rice (or 2X sachets cooked rice packs)
- Fresh corriander for serving

**Peanut Sauce**
- 1/2 cup peanut butter
- 1/3 cup soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons sesame oil (toasted or dark)
- 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
- 2 tablespoons sambal oelek or chili paste
- 2 tablespoons sugar, honey, or agave
- a small knob of fresh ginger, peeled
- a clove of fresh garlic, peeled
- 1/4 cup water


## Method
- Slice tofu and press liquid out of the tofu. Cube tofu and toss (gently) with the cornstarch until coated. 
- Arrange on a baking sheet lined with parchment. Arrange broccoli and peppers on another baking sheet. Drizzle all with olive oil and salt. 
- Roast both pans at 220 degrees celsius for 20-30 minutes, until tofu is slightly crisped and broccoli is roasty and delicious.
- While the tofu and broccoli are roasting, cook the rice.
- Make the sauce by blending everything in a blender or food processor.
- Serve with corriander
