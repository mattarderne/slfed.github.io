## Ingredients
- 1kg baby potatoes, halved
- 2 tbsps olive oil
- 1 tsp sea salt
- 240g green beans
- 300g beansprouts
- A handful of fresh coriander, to serve

**Dressing**
- 50g crunchy peanut butter
- 80ml coconut milk
- 30ml lime juice
- 1½ tbsps soy sauce
- 1 fresh red chilli, grated
- 2.5cm ginger, grated

## Method
- Preheat the oven to 180°C fan/200°C
- Mix the potatoes in a roasting tin with the oil and salt, then transfer to the oven and cook for 40 minutes.
- Meanwhile, mix together all the ingredients for the dressing. Depending on your brand of peanut butter, you may need to add a little more coconut milk so you have a thick, spoonable dressing consistency. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed.
- Once the potatoes have had 40 minutes, add the green beans and beansprouts. Add a splash more oil if needed, then return to the oven for a further 20 minutes.
- Sprinkle the potatoes and vegetables with the coriander and serve warm or at room temperature, with the dressing alongside
