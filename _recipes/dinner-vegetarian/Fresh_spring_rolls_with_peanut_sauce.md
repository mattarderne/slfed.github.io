## Ingredients
**Springrolls**
- 2 cakes rice vermicelli (optional but nice to bulk up springrolls)
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- ¼ teaspoon fine sea salt
- 1 cup torn butter lettuce
- 1 cup very thinly sliced red cabbage
- 2 medium carrots, peeled and cut into matchsticks or sliced into strips 
- 1 small cucumber, thinly sliced or sliced into strips 
- (optional) sprouts
- (optional) ¼ cup thinly sliced green onions
- (optional) sesame seeds
- (optional) salted peanuts
- ¼ cup roughly chopped fresh cilantro
- ¼ cup roughly chopped fresh mint
- 8 sheets rice paper (spring roll wrappers)

**Dipping Sauce**
- ⅓ cup peanut butter
- 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 1 tablespoons toasted sesame oil
- (optional) 2 cloves garlic, pressed or minced
- 2 to 3 tablespoons water, as needed


## Method
- To make the spring rolls: Bring a pot of water to boil and cook the noodles just until al dente, according to package directions. Drain, rinse them under cool water, and return them to the pot. Off the heat, toss the noodles with the sesame oil and salt, and set aside.
- Prepare all the fillings for the springrolls
- Make the dipping sauce by pulsing all ingredients in a blender (or mix by hand)
- At the table, have a shallow bowl of bowling water, let guests dip their own wraps in the water, fill and then eat.
