## Ingredients
- 1 punnet baby tomaotes
- 1 tin cooked green or brown lentils
- 1/2 white onion, chopped
- 1 small block feta cheese, cubed
- 1 bag rocket
- 1 aubergine, cubed
- (optional) 1 clove garlic, finely chopped
- (optional) 5 sundried tomatoes
- (optional) 2 slices bread (for crutons) 

**Dressing**
- 1 Tablespoon honey
- 1 Tablespoon red wine vinegar
- 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar

## Method
- Preheat your oven to 220°C. 
- Lay out tomatoes and aubergine on baking tray and roast with olive oil, salt and pepper. Roast until soft and charred, 15-18 mins.
- If you're making crutons: tear the ciabatta into roughly 2cm chunks and pop on another baking tray. Drizzle with oil and season with salt and pepper. Bake on the middle shelf of the oven until golden, 8-10 mins.
- Heat a drizzle of oil in a frying pan on medium-high heat and add the shallot. Fry until soft, 2-3 mins, then stir in the garlic and sundried tomatoes. Fry for another minute then add the lentils to the pan and stir together. Season to taste with salt and pepper and turn the heat to low.
- Combine dressing, taste and add anything needed to balance it. 
- Add everything together ontop of a bed of rocket and serve immediately.
