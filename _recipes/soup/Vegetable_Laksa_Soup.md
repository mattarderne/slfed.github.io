## Ingredients
- 150g Mushrooms, sliced
- 1/2 lime zested and juiced
- 1 stalk of lemongrass
- 1 Tablespoon Thai red curry paste
- 1 vegetable stock block
- 25g salted peanuts
- 25ml soya sauce
- 1 bell pepper, sliced
- (optional) 1 spring onion, trimmed and thinly chopped
- 3 cm ginger, grated
- 200ml coconut milk
- 2 Tablespoons peanut butter
- 2 nests egg noodles
- Corriander for serving

## Method
- Heat a splash of oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. When hot, add the mushrooms, pepper and lemongrass. Stir and cook until softened, 2-3 mins. Add the ginger puree and Thai style spice blend. Cook for 1 min. 
- Pour in the coconut milk and bring to a simmer. Stir in the vegetable stock paste and water for the sauce along with peanut butter.
- Simmer until the veggies are soft, 3-4 mins.
- Meanwhile, roughly chop the peanuts.
- When the veggies are soft, stir in the noodles. Make sure they are submerged in the laksa. Simmer until tender, about 4 mins. TIP: The noodles may soak up some of the coconutty liquid. If this is the case, just add a splash of water to get it back to a soupy consistency.
- Remove and discard the lemongrass. Stir in the soy sauce and lime zest, then add lime juice and salt to taste. Share between your bowls and finish with a sprinkle of peanuts and spring onion or corriander.
