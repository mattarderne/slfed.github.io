## Ingredients
- 1 cup Instant/porridge Oats
- 1/2 - 1 cup plain Flour	
- 1/2 cup Dates	, chopped
- 1/4 cup Brown Sugar 
- 1/2 cup coconut Oil
- 1 Cup beaten egg
- 1 teaspoon Baking powder	
- 1/2 teaspoon Baking soda
- Optional: 1 Tablespoon cocoa	
- 2 teaspoons Vanilla Extract	


## Method
- Preheat oven to 180° C
- Blend oats roughly in blender- I like to leave about 1/4 unblended for texture
- Mix together oats, flour, baking powder, baking soda and cocoa if you're adding
- In a separate bowl mix together melted coconut oil, sugar, chopped dates and vanilla- stir until sugar dissolves. 
- Mix wet and dry ingredients and add egg. If the mixture is too dry, add some milk, if it's too dry, add some more flour.
- Grease a baking tray and add balls of dough and flatten with a fork or your fingers.
- Bake for 20-25 minutes and allow to cool.
