## Ingredients
- 500g butter
- 1 cup/210g brown sugar (or sugar substitute)
- 3 eggs
- 500ml/512g buttermilk (or replace with any dairy of your choice with 2 T lemon juice)
- 1 cup/130g wholewheat flour (can replace with more self raising if you don't have/want)
- 1 kg self raising flour
- 2 t/10g baking powder
- 1 t/5grams cream of tartar (can replace with1 T lemon juice)
- 6 cups dry ingredients (my usual combination: 2.5 cups muesli, 2 cups bran flakes, 1 cup seed mix, 1/2 cup chopped almonds) 



## Method
- Preheat oven 180 degrees celsius.
- Have two bowls: a medium wet ingredient bowl & a very big dry ingredient bowl. 
- In the wet ingredient bowl: Cream the softened butter and sugar until whipped with an electric beater. Add eggs and keep beating until mixed. Add the buttermilk and fold in with a spoon (not the mixer). 
- In the very big other bowl: Mix all dry ingredients (all flour, baking power, cream of tartar, museli bits) and mix well.
- Add the mixed wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Start by mixing with a spatula but eventually you'll need to use your hands.
- Use the wrapper of the butter to grease a baking tray, we use one that is 40x34cm big but you could also use two smaller ones. Flatten the batter into the baking tray. 
- Bake for 30 minutes, take tray out and cut pieces with sharp knife. Bake for another 30 minutes or until knife comes out clean. You may need to bake for up to an additional hour depending on how big your baking container is and therefore how thick your batter is. 
- Allow to cool slightly then cut into rusk size bits in the same place you cut earlier. 
- Lay out on a large baking tray and dry out overnight in the oven on it's lowest heat (we use 70degrees) with a wooden spoon wedged in to keep the door a little open. You might want to shake them around or tip them over halfway. Check that it's completely dried out by breaking open bigger pieces- there should be no moisture left inside. You could also use a dehydrator if you have one. 
- Store in a airtight container.
