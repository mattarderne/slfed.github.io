## Ingredients
- 2 cups rolled oats
- 8 medjool dates, pits removed (if your dates are dry, first soak them in boiling water)
-  1/2 cup coconut or olive oil
- 1/4 cup real maple syrup or honey
- 3–4 carrots whizzed in blender (about 2 cups total)
- 2 eggs
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
- pinch of salt
- walnuts or raisins (optional)



## Method
- Preheat oven to 180 degrees
- Start by whizzing oats in the blender, it doesn't need to be oat flour consistancy, just smoother than oats. If your blender is small then keep these aside and do next bit. 
- Whizz carrots in blender until shredded or you could grate them before. 
- Whizz the rest of the ingredients (dates, oil, honey, baking soda, cinnamon,salt) in the blender.
- If you've blended oats, carrots and rest of ingredients separately, mix them all together to make the batter at this point. 
- Hand mix in raisins/currents/walnuts. 
- Grease a muffin pan with coconut oil and divide mixture. Sprinkle walnuts ontop if you like. 
- Bake for 15-30 minutes until they no longer jiggle in the middle. Allow them to cool as they stay together better when cooler.
- Serve with honey or butter.
