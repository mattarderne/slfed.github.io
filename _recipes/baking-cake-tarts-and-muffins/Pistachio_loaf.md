## Ingredients
- 1 cup roasted salted shelled pistachios
- 1/2 cups granulated sugar (use 3/4 cup if you like it sweeter)
- 1/2 cup cold unsalted butter, cut into chunks
- 3 eggs
- 1/4 cup milk or milk alternative
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon sea salt
- 1/2 cup coconut flour (or blitz dessicated coconut in a blender)
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch

## Method
- Preheat oven to 165 celsius
- Pulse the pistachios and sugar in a food processor until it makes a fine powder.
- Add the butter; pulse until incorporated. If your processor is small, you might want to remove this and then do the next bits and incorporate at the end. 
- Add the eggs, milk, and vanilla; pulse until incorporated.
- Add the baking powder, coconut flour, all-purpose flour, salt, and cornstarch; pulse until incorporated. 
- Transfer to a standard size loaf pan lined with parchment paper. Bake for about 1 hour, although sometimes it needs 1 hour and 10 minutes – you’ll know it’s done when the top / center no longer feels jiggly when you touch it.
- Remove from the oven, gently remove from the pan, and allow to cool. The loaf will rise but it will be flat on top, looking a lot like a big brick – that’s exactly how it should be. Eat it warm (so good) or, for clean slices, pop it in the fridge! (I usually store mine in the fridge for 3-4 days, if it lasts that long.)
